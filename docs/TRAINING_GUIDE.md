# Training Guide — building a model that sorts with confidence

SortIQ identifies brass by **look, not by name**: every photo maps to a
point in an embedding space, and a case is called by whichever class's
gallery examples sit closest. That one fact drives everything in this
guide. A class whose images all look alike produces tight, confident
matches; a class that quietly mixes two different looks produces thin
margins, hesitant calls, and rejects that should have been sorts.

The workflow below takes a dataset from "a pile of labeled photos" to a
model that identifies at 99%+ with margins to spare.

## 1 · Split classes by look, not by brand

Most headstamp names cover several physically different dies. "FC"
brass arrives plain, with dots, with close-set dots, with numbers, with
tiny diamonds. "WIN" arrives plain, with numbers, as +P. To a human
they're all one brand; to the matcher they are **different looks**, and
lumping them into one class forces its gallery to stretch across all of
them — which drags the whole class's match quality down and blurs the
line against genuinely different brands.

**The rule: if you can see the difference in the app's crop view, give
it its own class.** `FC` and `FC DOTS` and `FC DIAMONDS`, not one big
`FC`. A mark of a few pixels — a small diamond between two words — is
enough to justify a split.

What a split buys you, concretely: a variant living inside its parent
class typically matches with margins of +0.01–0.03 (coin-flip
territory, constant near-rejects). After splitting and retraining, the
same images match their own class at +0.10–0.30 — decisive, every time.

Don't worry about splitting "too small". A class is trainable at 10
images and usable in the gallery even below that — few-shot
recognition of thin classes is what the gallery architecture is for.
Feed thin classes more brass as it shows up; they harden with every
image.

## 2 · Rejoin the variants with a family

Splitting improves *recognition* — but you rarely want six FC bins.
That's what **families** are for (Dataset page → Families): group
`FC`, `FC DOTS`, `FC DIAMONDS`, … into family `FC`, then assign the
*family* to a bin. Members sort into one bin as one unit, while
staying separate classes underneath.

Families also make close calls safe instead of wasteful. When the top
two candidates for a case are members of the same family headed to the
same bin, the machine accepts the call instead of rejecting it as
ambiguous — the case lands in the right bin either way, so hesitating
between siblings costs nothing. Without the family, that same near-tie
kicks a perfectly sortable case to the Unmatched bin.

The pattern to remember: **split for the model, family for the bin.**

## 3 · Keep classes clean — the scan loop

A mislabeled image doesn't just sit there quietly: the gallery's
exemplar picker favors unusual-looking images, so a wrong-class photo
tends to become an *exemplar* — actively vouching for the wrong class.
The Dataset page has two fast tools for this:

- **Scan for mislabels** — every image is checked against the whole
  gallery with its own vote masked out, and images that read as a
  different class are flagged for review. The scan covers the full
  dataset in seconds, so run it freely.
- **Duplicate scan** — finds the same physical case photographed more
  than once (re-run brass), pixel-verified so look-alike distinct
  cases never flag.

Run the loop after any big dataset session: **scan → fix what's
genuinely wrong → rebuild gallery → scan again.** Mislabels can shelter
each other (two wrong images vouching for each other), so a second
pass after fixes sometimes surfaces stragglers the first pass couldn't
see. The loop converges quickly — a clean dataset scans clean twice.

Two flags that are *not* mislabels, and what to do instead:

- **Worn-but-real stamps** (correct label, heavily worn die): keep
  them — they teach the model what worn examples look like — but mark
  them **Excluded** (the ⊘ badge in the gallery view) so they never
  become matching anchors. Deletion is for bad *photos* (ghosted,
  smeared), not bad *brass*.
- **Thin-class flags**: a 4-image class losing one image to a
  look-alike neighbor isn't mislabeled, it's hungry. More brass is the
  fix.

## 4 · Capture quality in, quality out

- Respect the **sharpness floor** — it exists to keep unusable photos
  out of training. If a batch capture reports a wave of blurry
  rejects, check the camera before filing anything: a soft batch is
  disposable (discard and re-run the same brass), a soft *dataset* is
  forever.
- Keep **imaging settings** (crop geometry, camera look) stable across
  a dataset. If you change them, rebuild crops and rebuild the
  gallery so training and sorting see the same picture.
- The batch intake filter keeps well-fed classes (500+) from bloating
  with routine look-alikes — it only files what adds information.
  Trust it; hand-picked additions bypass it by design.

## 5 · Retrain when the labels outgrow the model

The gallery updates instantly — new classes and new images work for
sorting as soon as you rebuild it. **Training** is what bakes the
distinctions into the embedding itself, and it's worth a run when:

- you've split variants out of a parent class (the big one — margins
  between the new siblings stay thin until a retrain teaches the
  model to see the difference),
- the dataset has grown substantially since the last run, or
- the bench/margins say a pair of classes keeps crowding each other.

After a training run, read the bench like this: closed-set accuracy is
the headline, **wrong-identity count is the one that must be zero**
(a reject costs a re-run; a wrong bin costs a mixed batch), and the
strangers number tells you how the model treats brass it has never
seen. Install, rebuild the gallery, and spot-check a freshly split
class's margins — healed margins are the receipt that the split took.

**The short version:** split every visible variant into its own class,
family them back together for the bins, scan-and-fix until clean,
retrain after splits, and keep the camera honest. Each step is minutes
of work, and together they're the difference between a sorter that
hesitates and one that just sorts.
